Our amazing website runs using data from the Twitter Search API (to get raw data about
existing posts) and sentiment analysis with the Text Processing API. We look at the key words within different tweets
and then judge its relevancy through sentiment analysis. We display the progress and
popularity of a post using raw data and histograms.
