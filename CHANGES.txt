Design changes:
We tried to stick as closely to our design document as possible.
However, because we were unable to find a way to schedule tweets to be posted
at a later time for the user, we replaced that element with an archives page.
Although we may not queue posts, users can still easily go back and post tweets
themselves. Additionally, storing data for graphs in our database proved to be
more convoluted than previously thought, so we were unable to display graphs of
past tweets.
