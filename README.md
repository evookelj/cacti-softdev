##About

Our project quenchr is a website that will help users quench their thirst for Likes and Followers by optimizing how and when they post.
Quenchr will look at sentiment, content, length, and contained media (e.g links, images) of past posts on the Twitter account of a user to find what results in the most activity.
It will also give the user the option to have our site post a given Tweet to their Twitter.
We will accomplish this using data from the Twitter Search API (to get raw data about existing posts) and sentiment analysis with the Text Processing API.
We will also display the progress and how popular a post gets using raw data and scattergram.
